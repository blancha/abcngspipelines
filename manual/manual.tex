\section{Introduction and philosophy}

The intent of abcngspipelines is to provide a flexible and modular framework in which to perform the analysis of next-generation sequencing data.
The pipeline can easily be modified either by changing the parameters in the configuration files, or by editing the source code directly.

The accent is always on simplicity, flexibility and full user control.
One manifestation of this philosophy is that the pipeline never performs the analysis directly. The pipeline simply generates the command scripts. This gives the opportunity to the end-user to verify and manually edit the command scripts.

\section{Configuration files}
There are 3 levels of configuration files: global, project, and user.

\section{Directory structue}
See Figure \ref{figure:directorystructure} for the recommended directory structure for your analyses.
The pipeline is however flexible enough to handle any directory structure.
